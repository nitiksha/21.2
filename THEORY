Assignment 21.2
Explain the different methods of
● mapper class and
● reducer class 

Mapper Class -





Mapper class has got four methods 

1)	Setup

2)	Map

3)	Run

4)	Clean up







Setup Method 

	As name suggests it is the first method executed before any of the other method is executed, this method is used 
for the setting up initial setups if needed before the actual mapping starts. e.g finding the cache file and using the
that file can be done in the setup phase of the mapping .


Map Method

	In this method the input is taken from the file line by line and converts in the key value format and sent 
to the reducer. Map method is called for each input split spawned by the input format from the job.




Run Method

	The default run() method simply takes each key / value pair supplied by the context and calls the map() method. This method  is overridden very rarely.



Clean up method- 


	During cleanup() is that you clean up any resources you may have allocated. There are other uses too, which is to flush 
out any accumulation of aggregate results.



Flow

Setup ---> Map -----> Clean up

















Reducer Class - 



As we know the reducer code reads the outputs generated by the different mappers as <Key,Value> pairs. 
The Reducer interface expects four generics, which define the types of the input and output key value pairs.
The first two parameters define the intermediate key and value types, the second two define the final output key and value types. 



Reducer has got same Setup , run and clean up method as in that of the mapper class with same functionality



Reduce method – 

The main task of  the reducer class is to perform user operation on all the mapper key value pairs sort and shuffle 
results and to combine these results into one output.
